<h1>The Pokemon Companion App</h1>

<p>An application that allows you to store your decks using your phone with ease.<BR> As a fan of the old pokemon card games, I had always run into the issue of forgetting what card needs to be in what deck, when some of my more powerful cards were needed in multiple decks. <strong>This was the answer I needed.</strong></p>
